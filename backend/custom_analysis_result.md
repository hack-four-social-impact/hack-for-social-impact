### 1. Executive Summary

This document is the transcript of a Parole Suitability Hearing for Emmanuel Young (CDCR Number: AK2960) held on October 24, 2024, at Salinas Valley State Prison. Mr. Young, represented by attorney Rosemary Mbelu, stipulated to unsuitability for parole for a period of three years. This stipulation was made to allow Mr. Young to address disciplinary issues (rule violations), engage in more self-help programs, and seek clarification on a past court order regarding his sentence and parole eligibility dates. The Commissioners provided extensive feedback and recommendations focusing on his need to address violent behavior (particularly domestic violence), drug use, self-awareness of his controlling offense (second-degree murder), and to demonstrate sustained prosocial behavior and engagement in rehabilitative programming.

### 4. Procedural or Legal Concerns Noted

*   **Discrepancy in Parole Eligibility:** Mr. Young raised a significant concern regarding why he was not brought to the Board in 2022, despite his MEPD being set for that year after his initial life term was vacated and he was re-sentenced to 15 years to life. The Commissioners explained that a change in MEPD does not automatically trigger a new hearing if a denial has already been issued, but advised him to contact the BPH Legal Division for a formal, written clarification.
*   **ADA Accommodation Review:** A review was conducted regarding Mr. Young's need for glasses. Although a magnifying device was provided as he didn't have his glasses, he stated it "doesn't really work." This was acknowledged but not further resolved in the transcript.
*   **Stipulation Process:** The Commissioners formally verified that Mr. Young's request to stipulate to unsuitability was made of his own free will, without coercion or threats, and that he understood the implications (a three-year delay for the next suitability hearing).
*   **Post-Decision Review Process:** The transcript clearly outlines the legal process for the proposed decision to become final (within 120 days) and the Governor's authority to review and potentially affirm, modify, or reverse the Board's decision (Penal Code Sections 3041.1 and 3041.2).

    *   **Provide Resources:** Email the self-help document/packet to both Mr. Young (via correctional staff) and his attorney, Ms. Mbelu.
