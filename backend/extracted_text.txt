Dictate Express Transcription PROCEEDINGS 1 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WEILBACHER :  We're on the record, 2 
sir. 3 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right.  Today's date 4 
is, uh, Thursday, October 24, 2024.  And this is the first 5 
subsequent Parole Suitability Hearing for Mr. Young, who is 6 
currently housed at Salinas Valley State Prison.  Mr. Young 7 
was received by the Department of Corrections and 8 
Rehabilitation on November 18, 2011, uh, for the controlling 9 
offense of second-degree murder.  He received a term of 15 10 
years of life with enhancements for the use of a deadly 11 
weapon, and he has a minimum eligible parole date of November 12 
2, 2022.  Um, today's proceedings are being, uh, audio 13 
recorded.  So for the purpose of voice identification, all 14 
participants will be asked to state their full name, spell 15 
their last name.  Mr. Young, you'll go after your attorney, 16 
Ms. Mbelu.  And in addition to spelling your last name, when 17 
we get to you, we'll need your CDCR Number.  I'll go first 18 
and then I'll prompt all the other participants.  My name is 19 
Michael Ruff.  Last name spelling is R-U-F-F.  I am a 20 
Commissioner with the Board of Parole Hearings.  I am 21

DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WEILBACHER :  My name is James 24

Dictate Express Transcription with the Board of Parole Hearings, appearing in the same 1 
fashion. 2 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Ms. Mbelu. 3 
ATTORNEY MBELU :  Good morning.  My name is Rosemary 4 
Mbelu, M-B-E-L-U, attorney for Mr. Young, appearing via video 5 
conference. 6 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right, Mr. Young. 7 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   My name is Emmanuel Young.  Young, Y-O- 8 
U-N-G.  My CDC Number is AK2960.  I'm in -- I'm an inmate at 9 
Salinas Valley State Prison and, uh, this is my hearing. 10 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right, thank you.  We 11 
also note Correctional Staff may be in the room They're there 12 
for security purposes only.  Mr. Young, I want to swear you 13 
in.  If you may please raise your right hand. 14 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 15 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  You solemnly swear, affirm 16 
the testimony you give at today's hearing be the truth, the 17 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 18 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 19 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right, you can put 20 
your hand down.  I'm going to do what's called the Americans 21 
with Disability Review.  I did review the DECS database.  22 
Noticed you signed your request for assistance form, is Form 23 
1073 and have a TABE score of 12.0.  In regards to 24 
accommodations, it says you wear glasses.  Did you bring your 25 
5 
Dictate Express Transcription glasses to the hearing room? 1 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   No, I did not, sir. 2 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  There should be a 3 
magnifying device in the room.  Is there one on the table or 4 
something that looks like a sheet of paper there? 5 
EMMANUEL YOUNG :  No, sir. 6 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Is the officer in there? 7 
EMMANUEL YOUNG :  (Inaudible) that. 8 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Yeah -- yeah, that's it.  9 
That's -- that's your magnifying device.  Yeah, that's -- 10 
EMMANUEL YOUNG :  (Inaudible) it doesn't really work. 11 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  You keep putting it to the 12 
screen.  Um, no, that -- that -- that would -- that would -- 13 
it would be like a magnifying device if you didn't have your 14 
glasses.  Any other accommodations we're not aware of, like a 15 
hearing aid, back brace, knee brace? 16 
EMMANUEL YOUNG :  No, sir -- no, sir. 17 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right.  Counsel, it's 18 
my understanding you have a request? 19 
ATTORNEY MBELU :  Yes, Commissioner.  We are requesting 20 
for stipulation -- three-year stipulation for unsuitability 21 
because here he wants to go ahead and address his rule 22 
violation and also get more self-help program.  And that 23 
we're asking the Panel to give him an insightful 24 
recommendation in how to be better prepared at his next 25 
6 
Dictate Express Transcription hearing.  And, um, in addition to that, I think Mr. Young 1 
will also want the opportunity to address some court order 2 
that he -- so was it two years ago, so I'll let him go ahead 3 
and address that if the Panel will help me in any manner 4 
regarding that court order.  So that's -- those are the 5 
requests that we have this morning. 6 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right, so, Mr. Young, 7 
did you make this request to stipulate of your own free will? 8 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir -- yes, sir, I did. 9 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Were you coerced or 10 
threatened? 11 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Not in any way. 12 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  You understand by 13 
stipulating, you're stipulating you're not suitable, you 14 
would not be scheduled for another suitability hearing until, 15 
uh, on or before 20 -- 2027? 16 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 17 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right.  It does not 18 
preclude you from Petition To Advance if you felt that maybe 19 
you've improved to the point to where you wanted to try to go 20 
back to your hearing earlier.  Um, what's this question you 21 
have about a court order?  We don't usually respond or have 22 
any responses to anything that has to do with a court order, 23 
but what is it?  Uh, I will hear you out.  What is -- what 24 
specifically are you referring to? 25 
7 
Dictate Express Transcription EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Well, uh, my, uh, initial -- thank you, 1 
sir, first of all.  Uh, my initial life term, uh, what's 2 
seven to life plus six years.  And, um, it -- it concluded 3 
with me coming to Board, I believe in 2019.  Uh, after 2020, 4 
that specific life term was vacated.  And I was, uh, re- 5 
sentenced with that, with, uh, to sen -- 15 of life.  With 6 
that life-term, having me going to Board in 2022.  2022, I 7 
was never brought up to Board and that, you know, really 8 
crippled my rehabilitation and everything like that.  I 9 
wanted to know why I was never brought to Board in 2022, yet 10 
this is being called my subsequent, uh, Board Hearing when 11 
that initial life-term was vacated?  And I just wanted -- 12 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Well, I can -- I can try 13 
to answer your question.  Um, and I'll have the Deputy 14 
Commissioner weigh in also if he has some insight in regards 15 
to this.  So if you were originally -- you said you had a 16 
seven year to life term, your sentence -- it does show on my 17 
records your -- your sentence was amended -- 18 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 19 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- to, uh, second-degree 20 
murder.  Second-degree murder occurs a 15-year to not, uh, 21 
life term, uh, attempted murder carries a seven-year to life 22 
term.  So -- 23 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 24 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- you got a five-year 25 
8 
Dictate Express Transcription denial at your initial Parole Suitability Hearing. 1 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 2 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF : That was based on the Board 3 
seeing you, you were eligible at that time, uh, for parole or 4 
-- or they wouldn't have bought you there.  All right, so -- 5 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 6 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- the MEPD changing has 7 
to do with the amended sentence.  The amended sentence just 8 
says that you were eligible now to be released based on the 9 
amendment in 2022, but you had already received the five-year 10 
denial.  For you to get a better, uh, answer, it might be 11 
better if you write the BPH regarding that.  Um, I'm not sure 12 
that it would've, uh, changed unless that, uh, sentence got 13 
saved to a determinant term where your release date would've 14 
been changed.  But you're still, as far as I'm concerned, 15 
even with the modification, you're still controlled by the 16 
Board.  Meaning you have an indeterminate term and the Board 17 
will determine when you're going to be released.  So maybe 18 
Commissioner Weilbacher can add something to that. 19 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WEILBACHER :  You know, Commissioner, 20 
I really can't, I can add that information and verify the 21 
same information you had already had a hearing in 2019.  And 22 
so that's the -- that's the reason.  They don't just bring 23 
you back because your MEPD changes, you're already in the 24 
process.  However, to confirm that information, I can give 25 
9 
Dictate Express Transcription you the same thing that the Commissioner has said.  If you go 1 
on to your tablet and you get the information for the Board 2 
of Parole Hearings, the legal division, you can write them 3 
and then you can ask them to verify that information.  So 4 
you'll have it in writing from them that policy.  It's also 5 
contained in the parolee, uh, or the -- the -- 6 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Handbook. 7 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WEILBACHER :  -- the handbook that 8 
they just created, it'll be able to explain those things.  9 
But once you're in the process, you're in it.  And so then 10 
you -- 11 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   So -- so, my question was, my -- my -- 12 
my Board hearing date wasn't predicated on the court -- on 13 
the court ruling -- on the court order.  It was predicated on 14 
-- on pretty much, uh -- uh, the Board finding.  Because my - 15 
- my question is that the initial life term was -- was 16 
amended, but that part was vacated.  And every -- the only 17 
thing -- only part that was left on that term was the, uh, 18 
definite -- 19 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Yeah. 20 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   -- was -- was the -- the -- the -- was 21 
sentence which -- which had -- had been stayed.  But if we're 22 
going to address that, it was -- it was -- so my thing was 23 
that secondary or the -- the -- the current life term had me 24 
going to Board in 2022.  But it -- it -- but I kind of 25 
10 
Dictate Express Transcription understand what you're saying, Mr. Ruff, that once that 1 
process started, even though that term was vacated, it was no 2 
longer -- it was out in that -- the hands of the court. 3 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Right.  And -- and it -- 4 
and it really would -- I mean, I don't want to be negative 5 
about it.  It wouldn't have made a difference in that even if 6 
MEPD changed, you're still controlled by the Board.  See, now 7 
where it would've changed for you is if you would've went 8 
from an indeterminate to a determinant.  So if they would've 9 
gave you like a flat term of you're going to do 15 years and 10 
you're out.  Yeah.  Unless you catch a new case, you're out.  11 
All right.  But, um, I like what Commissioner Weilbacher 12 
said, um, our -- we have a whole legal division that focuses 13 
on release dates and they -- they can assist you with maybe a 14 
more succinct answer to your question. 15 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yeah. 16 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Um, now I'm going to give 17 
you some advice.  Um -- 18 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 19 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- so me and Commissioner, 20 
we do, uh, hearings and we do consultations.  Commissioners - 21 
- Deputy Commissioners do a number of other, uh, tasks, um, 22 
in addition to that.  Um, so it is smart that you stipulated 23 
today because you've got a lot going on and, you know, um, so 24 
my recommendation, it's going to be candid and you can take 25 
11 
Dictate Express Transcription it or leave it.  You -- you -- first and foremost, you can't 1 
get any more 115s.  You can't come to the Board and expect to 2 
get a date and you still got violence going on because your 3 
crime is quite violent.  Um, I don't know if you've done an 4 
Olson review? 5 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 6 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  But if you haven't, you 7 
should do one before your next hearing.  Go and read the 8 
transcripts from your case.  Because when I read your version 9 
of what happened, and I read the version from the victim of 10 
what happened, this -- this -- the victim who you knew for 11 
about five months, and you know, her version is significantly 12 
different than yours.  It makes your version look like you're 13 
minimizing because, um, she was beat to death basically.  And 14 
-- and her version of it is you wanted her to use some 15 
methamphetamine.  She didn't want to, and then you accused 16 
her cheating.  And then the beating started.  And then these 17 
witnesses who are in these reports, they report that.  So my 18 
expectation if you came before me and the Board, is that you 19 
one, have a self-awareness, meaning understanding of why this 20 
crime occurred.  Some people say, well, I was on meth, or I 21 
was on PCP, I was on crack.  And my question is always were - 22 
- were you using those drugs before?  And if your answer is 23 
yes, did you beat anyone to death?  Did you do this?  Did you 24 
do that?  No.  Then you can't blame it on the drugs.   25 
12 
Dictate Express Transcription EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Right. 1 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  The drugs may have been an 2 
inhibitor.  Right?  And they may have made you do something 3 
that you didn't have the -- I won't say you didn't have the 4 
ability to stop, that you chose not to stop.  So there's more 5 
to it, you know, you should -- when you come before the 6 
Board, first and foremost, you should demonstrate a prolonged 7 
period of, "prosocial behavior.”  Meaning if your crime is 8 
violent, there can't be any violence with anyone.  And how 9 
old are you now, Mr. Young? 10 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   I'm 40 -- 42, sir. 11 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  You're not a kid anymore, 12 
so you -- you grown man.  All right. 13 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 14 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  And -- and you got to use, 15 
you know, I didn't -- I -- I know a lot of people found 16 
success in anger management and they talk about -- the one 17 
that I hear most of people talk about GOGI, boss of my own 18 
brain, you know.  And -- and really I worked in that system.  19 
I worked at San Quentin 12 and a half years.  I worked at DVI 20 
another five, and then I was with SSU and the manager and -- 21 
and I retired and I came back and worked for the Board for 22 
now almost seven years.  And I can tell you that, um, I -- I 23 
understand the violence of prison in general.  When I started 24 
at San Quentin, there was shots being fired and I witnessed 25 
13 
Dictate Express Transcription things that I could write books about my first couple years 1 
there.  So I understand the prison -- prison environment, but 2 
I also understand that as you get older, you start -- you 3 
start playing I don't know if you play chess and checkers, 4 
but as you know, checkers is just jump the guy, crown me 5 
king.  Chess is thinking two or three moves ahead.  Most time 6 
-- most of the time, not all the time.  Most of the time when 7 
there's a conflict, there's something to proceed the 8 
conflict, whether it be -- 9 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 10 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- somebody talking, 11 
"disrespectful.”  There's always going to be something 12 
usually.  Not -- I mean, if you're dealing with somebody who 13 
has mental health issues, maybe not.  But most of the time 14 
there's going to be something that tells you this is getting 15 
ready to go in a direction and so on and so forth.  If it is 16 
you -- if you're the person that can't control your anger, 17 
then you need to work on that.  You need to work on 18 
developing the tools to, uh, avoid anger.  Anger is a 19 
secondary emotion.  You know, you choose to be angry.  You 20 
know, if somebody says something to you in that environment, 21 
and -- and some people know if a person has a short temper, 22 
they go up to them and -- and gout them, you know, "hey man, 23 
F you.”  What you know, now it goes into a whole different 24 
level.  Now you're seeing red and -- and -- and you're ready 25 
14 
Dictate Express Transcription to fight.  You're going to have to show the Board one that 1 
you can no longer involved in fights.  You've been in quite a 2 
few fights this year.  One of them, you're found not guilty.  3 
One of them, you got a battery and another one.  So you got a 4 
couple fights.  You're going to -- you're going to have to 5 
show the Board, you're not a violent person anymore.  That 6 
you don't use your fist when you have conflict, that you've 7 
developed the necessary coping skills to avoid being angry.  8 
'Cause if you're angry in there, you're definitely going to 9 
be angry in the community.  'Cause there's a lot of things to 10 
you off.  The other thing is, um, domestic violence.  You 11 
should understand the cycle of violence.  You should 12 
understand domestic violence.  You should understand domestic 13 
violence and how it related to your own relationship and why 14 
it was part of that relationship.  I can tell you there was a 15 
common thing I heard in your statement, and it's almost -- if 16 
somebody asks me as a Commissioner, just interview me and 17 
say, what is the common thing you see in domestic violence?  18 
I said, jealousy or the -- the -- the perpetrator always 19 
believes that the victim was -- was cheating on them, whether 20 
they were cheating or not.  And, uh, that in itself 21 
demonstrates that there's some issues there that need to be 22 
resolved.  So I strongly encourage that you remain 23 
disciplinary free.  That you get engaged in programming, not 24 
just to get the certificate, but to actually learn from it.  25 
15 
Dictate Express Transcription So basically, because you're going to be back in the 1 
community, Mr. Young, and you got to be able to function 2 
because you only get so many bites of the apple.  If you get 3 
back up there and you're given your freedom again you can't - 4 
- you can't get in a -- you can't say you're still going to 5 
be young enough to get involved in a relationship.  And -- 6 
and -- and if you -- you haven't resolved those issues, your 7 
life will be there.  All right, any questions you have of me 8 
before I have, uh, Commissioner Weilbacher talk to you? 9 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Uh, no, thank you for it.  I just thank 10 
you. 11 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Yep.  Commissioner 12 
Weilbacher anything? 13 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WEILBACHER :  Yeah.  Thank you, 14 
Commissioner.  Yo -- you know, Mr. Young, I just want to 15 
ditto what the Commissioner said, but I'm just going to add 16 
one thing because I know you're hearing him, you're shaking 17 
your head, you're acknowledging him.  You're -- you're doing 18 
those positive things.  The domestic violence, of course, is 19 
crucial.  That's the reason I repeat it.  The Alternatives to 20 
Violence.  There are programs called AVP, Alternatives to 21 
Violence.  GOGI is the same thing I've heard about, is really 22 
good.  The -- all those programs.  Um, create relapse 23 
prevention plans for those that are real.  You -- you make 24 
sure that you -- you go over them a few times.  And then when 25 
16 
Dictate Express Transcription you come to the Board, you create a packet of those that you 1 
think are most important.  Now, I wrote this down in the 2 
stipulation, uh, that we -- we filled out today.  There's a 3 
little section, you'll see the reasons why.  Now usually I 4 
don't put those programs in like the Commissioner pointed 5 
out.  But I put them in this time so you could be reminded -- 6 
you -- I know you don't have a -- a memory issue, but I just 7 
want you to be able to look at that in the future.  And then 8 
the other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and 9 
email that document over to the officer.  And if you want, 10 
and with your counsel's understanding, there is a 11 
transitional housing program, self-help packet that I give 12 
out during -- that include correspondence courses that you 13 
can do in addition to the tablet that you have now is a world 14 
of information.  But it'll have addresses for you to write 15 
like GOGI, it'll have addresses for PREP and the Americans 16 
Community Corrections Institute.  It basically has all the 17 
programs that we can -- that we hear about.  It doesn't mean 18 
anyone's better than the other, but it means that you'll have 19 
those information besides your tablet, which is a world of 20 
information, uh, for you now with the programs they have on 21 
there.  So unless counsel has an objection to that, which, 22 
um, it's just a generic document we give to everybody, and in 23 
fact it goes around, the Counselor --Counsel probably has the 24 
same copy.  Uh, I'll -- I'll email those over and then the 25 
17 
Dictate Express Transcription officer will give them to you, okay? 1 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Okay.  Thank you, sir. 2 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WEILBACHER :  Yep.  Thank you. 3 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right -- all right.  4 
If you -- 5 
ATTORNEY MBELU :  Commissioner -- 6 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- don't have -- yes, go 7 
ahead. 8 
ATTORNEY MBELU :  -- I'm sorry.  Can you -- can you send 9 
me a copy so I have some, but I just want to see, crosscheck 10 
and see what you have and what I have.  I can always use that 11 
-- those and share with my clients also.  Thank you. 12 
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WEILBACHER :  I will do, yeah. 13 
ATTORNEY MBELU :  Thank you.  Okay. 14 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right. 15 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   And if you guys give me opportunity, I 16 
promise the next time I come, I'll be in a better light and 17 
I'll be I'll -- I'll -- I'll -- I'll make you guys proud, I 18 
promise. 19 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  Well, and the bottom line, 20 
Mr. Young -- 21 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 22 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- um, like I said, you 23 
only get so many bites of the apple.  You're still young 24 
enough that you can make the changes and get back in the 25 
18 
Dictate Express Transcription community, but you got to make the changes.  And then the 1 
other thing, how many points -- what's your current 2 
classification score? 3 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   I, uh, I, uh, I have a 68 points, sir. 4 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  All right.  So that's not 5 
bad compared to some of the ones I see where 300 and 6 
something, it's not good, but it's not bad.  It's -- it is -- 7 
it's -- it's low enough that you can get an override, but 8 
they're not going to give you an override when you're still 9 
involved in violence.  Sometimes the change of venue is what 10 
you need, is you need to get away from the environment that's 11 
not conducive to change.  All right.  Get around people who 12 
the majority of them are trying to get home.  They're not 13 
trying to stay there.  I think that the -- your location is 14 
not always conducive to, you know, if you want to make 15 
changes, you can't always make those changes.  All right?  So 16 
good luck going -- 17 
EMMANUEL YOUNG:   Yes, sir. 18 
PRESIDING COMMISSIONER RUFF :  -- forward and, uh, do it 19 
for yourself.  Do it for your family.  And do it for your -- 20
