## Parole Hearing Summary

This document summarizes the first subsequent Parole Suitability Hearing for Emmanuel Young, CDCR Number AK2960, held on October 24, 2024, at Salinas Valley State Prison. Mr. Young and his attorney, Rosemary Mbelu, requested a three-year stipulation of unsuitability, which was granted, to allow Mr. Young to address rule violations and engage in further self-help programming.

### Offense Context
Emmanuel Young was received by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation on November 18, 2011 (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 3, Lines 8-9). His controlling offense is second-degree murder, for which he received a sentence of 15 years to life with enhancements for the use of a deadly weapon (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 3, Lines 10-12). His minimum eligible parole date (MEPD) was November 2, 2022 (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 3, Lines 12-13). Mr. Young's original sentence was a "seven to life plus six years" term, which he states was vacated after 2020, leading to a resentencing of 15 years to life with a new Board date in 2022 (Emmanuel Young, Page 7, Lines 2-7). Presiding Commissioner Ruff confirmed that his sentence was amended to second-degree murder, a term of 15 years to life, differentiating it from attempted murder (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 7, Lines 17-23).

### Programming
Mr. Young's attorney requested the three-year stipulation because "he wants to go ahead and address his rule violation and also get more self-help program" (Attorney Mbelu, Page 5, Lines 22-24). The Board provided specific recommendations for future programming and engagement:
*   **Anger Management:** Commissioner Ruff advised Mr. Young to work on developing tools to "avoid anger," emphasizing that "Anger is a secondary emotion. You choose to be angry" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 13, Lines 18-20). He mentioned that "GOGI, boss of my own brain" and "Alternatives to Violence" (AVP) are programs where "a lot of people found success" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 12, Lines 17-20; Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher, Page 15, Lines 21-23).
*   **Domestic Violence Education:** Mr. Young was urged to "understand the cycle of violence" and how it "related to your own relationship" given the jealousy factor in his crime (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 14, Lines 11-15, 18-22).
*   **Relapse Prevention:** Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher recommended creating and reviewing "relapse prevention plans" (Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher, Page 15, Lines 23-25).
*   **Meaningful Engagement:** Commissioners stressed the importance of engaging in programming "not just to get the certificate, but to actually learn from it" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 14, Lines 24-25).
*   **Resource Packet:** Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher offered to email Mr. Young a "transitional housing program, self-help packet" containing information and addresses for correspondence courses from various organizations (Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher, Page 16, Lines 11-18, 24-26).

### Parole Factors Cited
Key factors influencing the Board's decision for a three-year stipulation and recommendations for future suitability included:
*   **Continued Violence and Disciplinary History:** Commissioner Ruff explicitly stated, "You can't get any more 115s. You can't come to the Board and expect to get a date and you still got violence going on" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 11, Lines 2-4). He noted that Mr. Young had "been in quite a few fights this year," with one resulting in a battery conviction (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 14, Lines 2-5). The Board requires demonstration that he is "no longer involved in fights" and has developed "coping skills to avoid being angry" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 14, Lines 1-9).
*   **Lack of Self-Awareness/Minimization of Crime:** The Board expressed concern about Mr. Young's understanding of his crime, stating his version of events "is significantly different than yours" compared to the victim's account and "makes your version look like you're minimizing" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 11, Lines 9-14). He was told to develop "a self-awareness, meaning understanding of why this crime occurred" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 11, Lines 20-21).
*   **Denial of Responsibility (Drugs):** Commissioner Ruff challenged Mr. Young's potential to blame drugs, asking if he committed similar acts before drug use, concluding: "Then you can't blame it on the drugs. The drugs may have been an inhibitor... that you chose not to stop" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 11, Lines 25-26; Page 12, Lines 2-4).
*   **Classification Score:** Mr. Young's current classification score is "68 points" (Emmanuel Young, Page 18, Line 5). Commissioner Ruff indicated this score is "low enough that you can get an override" but emphasized that an override would not be granted while he is "still involved in violence" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 18, Lines 7-10).
*   **Overall Conduct:** The Board expects Mr. Young to "demonstrate a prolonged period of, 'prosocial behavior'" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 12, Lines 7-8) and show he is "not the same person that committed this crime" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 18, Lines 23-26).

### Claim-of-Innocence Evidence
Mr. Young did not claim factual innocence but questioned procedural aspects of his sentencing and hearing schedule. He stated his initial "life term was vacated" after 2020 and he was "re-sentenced with... 15 of life" with an MEPD of "2022." He questioned why he "was never brought up to Board in 2022, yet this is being called my subsequent... Board Hearing when that initial life-term was vacated?" (Emmanuel Young, Page 7, Lines 2-13). He later clarified his confusion, asking if his hearing date was "predicated on the court ruling" or "the Board finding" (Emmanuel Young, Page 9, Lines 13-14).

### Contradictions
Two main areas of contradiction or discrepancy were discussed:
*   **Crime Narrative:** Presiding Commissioner Ruff identified a "significantly different" account of the crime between Mr. Young's version and the victim's, which was corroborated by witnesses. The victim's account described Mr. Young wanting her to use methamphetamine, her refusal, an accusation of cheating, and then "the beating started," leading to her being "beat to death basically" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 11, Lines 9-19). This divergence led Commissioner Ruff to conclude Mr. Young's version "look[s] like you're minimizing" (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 11, Lines 12-14).
*   **MEPD and Hearing Scheduling:** Mr. Young perceived a contradiction regarding his expected 2022 hearing (Emmanuel Young, Page 7, Lines 6-13). Commissioner Ruff explained that because Mr. Young had already received a "five-year denial" at his initial Parole Suitability Hearing in 2019, a subsequent change in MEPD due to an amended indeterminate sentence does not automatically trigger an earlier hearing; the Board still controls the release decision (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 8, Lines 1-2, 7-19). Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher confirmed this, stating, "They don't just bring you back because your MEPD changes, you're already in the process" (Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher, Page 8, Lines 23-24). Both commissioners advised Mr. Young to contact the Board of Parole Hearings' legal division for written clarification on this policy (Presiding Commissioner Ruff, Page 8, Lines 11-14; Deputy Commissioner Weilbacher, Page 9, Lines 2-6).
