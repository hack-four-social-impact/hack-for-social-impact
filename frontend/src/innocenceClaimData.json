Um, and then third and finally, and -- and probably most relevant and most -- most honest, um, was that it was for personal gratification. Uh, but it took multiple questions and multiple tries to get him to that admission.",

I have -- I have been searching my inner self, which led me to believe that I -- that it was okay to take an advantage of you. This monster, me, groom you for personal gratification. I traumatized you, caused you pain, caused you pain, distrust, stress, suffering, and to the point of relationship disorder. I do pray that you have sought help for any and all ill effects that I caused. I have applied myself into numerous self-help groups, especially child -- child sexual abuse. I can't express what I feel when I put myself in your shoes. It’s said that hurt people hurt people. There are other hurt people that are not in my situation. I made a conscience choice that I am a very ashamed of my aberrant actions, victimizing you. I'm sorry, could never heal your wound by taking your innocence from -- for you -- from you to give -- to forgive me. I don't expect you to. I just know -- I just know in my heart of rehabil -- rehabilitation, that this letter of amends is long -- is long overdue. I have reached out to others who have like crimes and believe that I -- if I can help to change their thinking process and belief system, not to victimize children, I believe I would've -- I would honor you since I'm sorry is not good enough for you.",
