  "markdown_summary": "## Parole Hearing Summary\n\n### Offense Context\nAlfredo Acosta, CDCR Number B07643, was present for his 22nd subsequent Parole Consideration Hearing on October 29, 2024, at Solano State Prison (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 3, Lines 5-8). He was convicted out of Kern County for two counts of first-degree murder, receiving a sentence of seven years to life (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 3, Lines 8-9). The victims were his wife, Jenny Juanita Acosta (34), his mother-in-law, Maria Sanchez, his brother-in-law, Isadoro, and his girlfriend, Victoria Mesias (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 3, Lines 9-13 & Page 72, Lines 10-14). Mr. Acosta was 27 at the time of the murders and is now 85 (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 3, Lines 19-21).\n\nAcosta testified that on the night of the murders in 1966, he saw his wife, Jenny, kissing another man in a back alley behind their home. After she returned 20-25 minutes later, he asked her to pack his clothes as he wanted a divorce. He was \"very upset\" and \"yelling\" (Alfredo Acosta, Page 19, Lines 5-25 & Page 20, Lines 6-8). He stated he \"felt impotent, frustrated without control\" and used \"violence to control her,\" feeling \"insecure,\" \"hurt,\" and \"jealous\" (Alfredo Acosta, Page 20, Lines 15-19). He claims he grabbed a gun when others tried to take his son, and upon grabbing it, \"you want to shoot the people that you believe you think they're hurting you\" (Alfredo Acosta, Page 21, Lines 11-26). He confirmed he intended to kill Jenny (Alfredo Acosta, Page 22, Line 4). After shooting Jenny, he claimed Isadoro hit him with a boot and Maria slapped him, making him \"more upset,\" leading him to shoot them (Alfredo Acosta, Page 22, Lines 15-18, 23-24). He then took his two daughters (7) and son (3) to his cousin's house, leaving them and the gun there (Alfredo Acosta, Page 23, Lines 8-12, 17-19 & Page 24, Lines 1-2). Subsequently, he went to his girlfriend Victoria's house and strangled her, explaining his jealousy that \"another man is going to enjoy her like I have been enjoying her\" (Alfredo Acosta, Page 24, Lines 4-8 & Page 25, Lines 8-12).\n\n### Programming\nMr. Acosta received a three-year denial at his last hearing in April 2023, with several recommendations (Deputy Commissioner Pingitore, Page 28, Lines 2-7). Since then, he has participated in various programs:\n*   **Criminal Thinking:** He states he learned \"that domestic violence is a system to maintain control over my partner\" (Alfredo Acosta, Page 28, Lines 15-18).\n*   **Domestic Violence:** He identified types of domestic violence as \"emotional, psychological, sexual, financial, physical, and verbal\" (Alfredo Acosta, Page 29, Lines 17-19). His attorney, Lori Kelley, noted he testified he \"brutally committed domestic violence in the perpetration of this crime\" (Attorney Kelley, Page 47, Lines 9-12).\n*   **Victim Awareness:** Completed since the last hearing (Deputy Commissioner Pingitore, Page 38, Lines 2-5).\n*   **Other Groups:** He referred to groups on \"criminal minds,\" \"how they mistreat their children,\" AA, and (inaudible) (Alfredo Acosta, Page 31, Lines 24-26 & Page 32, Lines 1-2).\n*   **Education & Vocational:** He obtained his GED and completed vocational auto mechanic training (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 77, Lines 1-5).\n*   The Board found his \"participation has been adequate and relevant to your character defects and the concerns that we had,\" assisting in \"identification of character defects\" and gaining \"tools and coping skills\" (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 76, Lines 10-15).\n\n### Parole Factors Cited\nThe Board granted parole, finding that Mr. Acosta \"does not pose an unreasonable current risk of danger if released\" (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 73, Lines 12-14). Key factors cited include:\n*   **Elder Parole:** Mr. Acosta qualified for elder parole due to his age (85), long-term confinement (58 years), and diminished physical condition (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 3, Lines 15-20, Page 41, Lines 17-19 & Page 72, Lines 20-24). The doctor concluded he represents a \"low risk for violence if released to the free community at this time,\" attributing decreased violence likelihood to age (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 73, Lines 20-21 & Page 78, Lines 4-7).\n*   **Offender Change (Mitigating):** The Board found \"present self-awareness and self-control and mental state and present character defects and causative factors have been addressed\" (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 78, Lines 7-10). He displayed \"consequential thinking,\" controlled his anger, and understood the impact on victims, with his mental state differing from the time of the crime (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 78, Lines 13-25).\n*   **Parole Plans (Mitigating):** He plans to return to Puerto Rico where his siblings reside, and has identified community resources like transitional housing. He developed relapse prevention plans for relationships, domestic violence, anger, and criminal thinking (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 79, Lines 1-7).\n*   **Institutional Behavior:** He has \"good reports\" from work and program participation (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 77, Lines 1-4). His last \"115\" (rules violation) was in 2016 (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 77, Line 9). He admitted to \"restitution circumvention for another incarcerated person years ago\" but denies unemployment fraud (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 39, Lines 18-25 & Page 77, Lines 20-21).\n*   **Aggravating Factors:** His \"self-control and mental state leading up to and at the time of the life crime\" were found \"aggravating\" due to anger, jealousy, criminal thinking, and need for control (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 74, Lines 10-15). The Board described his actions as \"cowardly, cruel, brutal, reckless, completely inexcusable and thoughtless\" (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 74, Lines 19-21) and the crime as \"horrific\" and \"dispassionate and calculated\" (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 75, Line 20, 26 & Page 76, Line 1).\n\n### Claim-of-Innocence Evidence\nMr. Acosta's testimony regarding the events of the crime did not explicitly claim innocence but minimized his culpability and provided a justification for his actions. He stated he \"didn't have a firearm\" in his 1959/1960 arrest (Alfredo Acosta, Page 16, Lines 13-14). For the life crime, he said he grabbed the gun after Maria and Isadoro reacted to him shooting Jenny (Alfredo Acosta, Page 22, Lines 15-23), implying a reactive rather than premeditated escalation towards them. Regarding Victoria, he previously claimed she \"wanted you to kill her\" but \"today you admitted that you were jealous\" (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 75, Lines 4-6).\n\nVictim next of kin, Delia Cortez, stated Acosta dragged Jenny \"by her hair when he saw her in the car talking with that man... She wasn't doing anything and she wasn't kissing or anything\" (Delia Cortez, Page 52, Lines 16-20). She further asserted that he \"beat his wife Jenny badly before he shot her to death\" (Delia Cortez, Page 52, Lines 21-23). Lillian Cortez, an eyewitness, testified Acosta \"already had beaten her up\" when he brought Jenny into the house (Lillian Cortez, Page 56, Line 26 & Page 57, Line 1). Lillian also contradicted Acosta's claim about his in-laws hitting him: \"My grandma and my uncle did not throw nothing at him. My grandma did not even slap him\" (Lillian Cortez, Page 58, Lines 12-14).\n\n### Contradictions\nSignificant contradictions emerged between Mr. Acosta's testimony and the victim next of kin statements:\n*   **Domestic Violence Prior to Murder:** Acosta claimed, \"with all the -- all the time that we were married, we never had any domestic violence happening, because I was going to sleep every night at home\" (Alfredo Acosta, Page 26, Lines 4-8). However, Delia Cortez stated, \"He beat his wife Jenny badly before he shot her to death\" and her \"face at the casket was horrible from the beating\" (Delia Cortez, Page 52, Lines 21-23). Lillian Cortez corroborated, saying \"he hit her real bad\" before bringing her inside (Lillian Cortez, Page 56, Lines 21-23). Delia also described Acosta's pattern of \"demanding and yelling and fighting with my aunt\" (Delia Cortez, Page 54, Lines 16-17).\n*   **Presence of Gun:** Acosta testified that he grabbed the gun during the argument (Alfredo Acosta, Page 21, Lines 11-14). Lillian Cortez, an eyewitness, stated he kept \"taking out the gun and we would get scared. And my grandma would say, 'No -- no, put it away.' He would put it back in his -- in his pants. And about five, ten minutes again, he would take it out again\" (Lillian Cortez, Page 57, Lines 7-10). Erlinda Cortez further highlighted this, stating Acosta told a previous panel he \"did not have the gun in his hand during the time that they were arguing,\" but \"Lily just shared with all of you and with us that he had it in his hand all the time\" (Erlinda Cortez, Page 63, Lines 8-12).\n*   **Victims' Actions:** Acosta claimed Isadoro hit him with a boot and Maria slapped him (Alfredo Acosta, Page 22, Lines 15-18). Lillian Cortez explicitly denied this: \"My grandma and my uncle did not throw nothing at him. My grandma did not even slap him\" (Lillian Cortez, Page 58, Lines 12-14 & Page 61, Lines 3-4).\n*   **Victoria Mesias' Pregnancy:** Delia Cortez stated Victoria Mesias \"was pregnant and carrying Acosta's baby\" and that he \"strangled her, his pregnant lover\" (Delia Cortez, Page 52, Lines 2-9). This information, if true, was not discussed or confirmed by Acosta or the Panel during the hearing.\n*   **Motivation for Victoria's Murder:** Acosta's previous testimony indicated Victoria \"begged him to kill her violently\" (Deputy District Attorney Nargie, Page 43, Lines 3-4), which he now contradicts by admitting he was jealous (Presiding Commissioner Cassady, Page 75, Lines 5-8). His attorney, Lori Kelley, noted this as \"Mr. Acosta's improvement in self-awareness\" (Attorney Kelley, Page 46, Lines 25-26 & Page 47, Lines 1-5).\n*   **Acosta's Remorse/Credibility:** The Deputy District Attorney stated, \"If you scratched the surface of Mr. Acosta's hearings present and past, nothing has changed\" regarding remorse, genuineness, credibility, and insight (Deputy District Attorney Nargie, Page 42, Lines 17-21). She further noted, \"18 months ago, Mr. Acosta smirked when the victims gave their impact statement\" (Deputy District Attorney Nargie, Page 42, Lines 21-23). The victims' families repeatedly called him a \"liar\" and expressed that he \"has no remorse\" (Delia Cortez, Page 53, Lines 20-24 & Page 54, Line 7; Lillian Cortez, Page 56, Line 21 & Page 61, Lines 1-2; Erlinda Cortez, Page 63, Line 18 & Page 67, Line 24).",
